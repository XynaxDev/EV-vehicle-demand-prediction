## üéØ Project Overview

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are revolutionizing transportation, but efficient charging infrastructure is essential for sustainable adoption. This project leverages historical charging station usage data, weather patterns, and traffic flows to build a predictive model for forecasting demand at individual charging points. By anticipating peak loads, stakeholders can optimize resource allocation, reduce wait times, and enhance grid stability.

<!-- ## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**: Automates fetching, cleaning, and merging datasets from multiple sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Interactive dashboards to visualize demand patterns and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Modular workflows for feature engineering, model training (Random Forest, RandomForestRegressor), and evaluation.
- **Real-Time Prediction API**: Flask-based REST endpoints for on-the-fly demand forecasting.
- **Deployment Ready**: Containerized with Docker and CI/CD templates for GitHub Actions. -->
